# Pocket Piggy

Pocket Piggy is a friendly and easy to use mobile app designed for parents and kids to collaborate on money management. Gift cards from grandma, allowance, money earned from chores - it can all be easily tracked and managed by Pocket Piggy. 

Parents can 
  * create family groups
  * add child accounts
  * deposit funds to child accounts
  * approve purchase requests by children
  * create and approve chores
  * view a ledger of past purchases

Children can
  * Create wishlists with an image uploader for things they want to buy and see savings progress for each item
  * Get approval from a parent to buy something once they've saved enough
  * Accept chore assignments and earn money for the things they want
  * View a ledger of their account balance, all their past purchases, and money earned.
